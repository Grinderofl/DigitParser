Program to parse all numeric digits in a text file and convert their values into ASCII characters, based on

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12991606/how-to-take-in-digits-0-255-from-a-file-with-no-delimeters

Improvements should be made in future to allow a different set of parsing, such as reading numbers contiguously rather than until 255 is passed.
